# Welcome

This is the companion site for the 420-2W6 course.

In this website you will find all the notes, labs and exercises for the course.

This site is live at [maujac.github.io/2W6-UI](https://maujac.github.io/2W6-UI)



## Why a new website?
The previous GitBook interface had a few limitations, namely:
- HTML code could not be imbedded directly into the Markdown;

- Images could not be resized at will;

- Lack of HTML support created discrepancies with local repository;

- GitBook's pdf export was a paid feature;
  
  
## How is this page made?
This webpage is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), built with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and deployed via [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) .



## Source Code
This page is open source, visit the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/mau-jac/2W6-UI).
